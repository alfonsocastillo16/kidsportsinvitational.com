Stephen was a very loving son and brother and was a loyal and trusted friend who always had time to encourage and support others. In general, Stephen was an incredibly passionate young man. He had a zest for life and gave 100% to whatever he pursued. Stephen was passionate about many things; his family, his friends, and The Ducks.</p>
